BrowserStack is _really_ **awesome**. I find it really useful that the mobile
devices run on the same OS versions from when they shipped. I can therefore
see how a page looks with the browser features of the time, as opposed to
checking only viewport characteristics as is often the case with browser
developer tools.
I **strongly** encourage you to give BrowserStack a try. (They are _quite_
generous with open source projects :wink:.)
